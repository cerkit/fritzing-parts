# fritzing-parts
For sharing custom Fritzing parts that I have created.

### Mojo v3 FPGA
The first part that I made is for the Mojo v3 FPGA board. I have been needing to use it in some documentation, so I spent a good 3-4 weeks getting it set up.

I used Photoshop to process the image of the board so that I could more easily edit it in Adobe Illustrator. I hand drew the components in Illustrator based on the placement on the board after converting the image to an image-trace. I did this to reduce the size of the SVG file and to make it conform to Fritzing design guidelines.

The board uses internal connections for `GND`, `V+` (+3v3), and `RAW` (+5v).

## Where to find the parts

All of the parts are stored in the *fzpz* folder.
