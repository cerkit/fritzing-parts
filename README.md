# fritzing-parts
For sharing custom Fritzing parts that I create.

### Mojo v3 FPGA
The first part is for the Mojo v3 FPGA board. I have been needing to use it in some documentation, so I spent a good 120 hours getting it set up.

I used Photoshop to process the image of the board so that I could more easily edit it in Adobe Illustrator. I hand drew the components based on the placement on the board after converting the image to an image-trace. I did this to reduce the size of the SVG file and to make it conform to Fritzing design rules.

The board uses internal connections for GND, V+ (+3v3), and RAW (+5v).

## Where to find the parts

All of the parts are stored in the [fzpz](./tree/master/fzpz) folder.
