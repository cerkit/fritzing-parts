# fritzing-parts
For sharing custom Fritzing parts that I have created.

### Mojo v3 FPGA
The first part that I made is for the Mojo v3 FPGA board. I have been needing to use it in some documentation, so I spent a good 3-4 weeks getting it set up.

*Note: The PCB layer may not line up correctly. I made this part mostly to use the breadboard and schematic views. Double-check all the measurements before making a board with this part. Ideally, you'd have two 25x2 male headers and 1 2x5 header on your board and run a ribbon. A [Proto Shield](https://embeddedmicro.com/products/proto-shield.html) is available from Embedded Micro to help you with your designs. I am trying to get the Eagle files for the Proto Shield so I can use them for the PCB view.*

I used Photoshop to process the image of the board so that I could more easily edit it in Adobe Illustrator. I hand drew the components in Illustrator based on the placement on the board after converting the image to an image-trace. I did this to reduce the size of the SVG file and to make it conform to Fritzing design guidelines.

The board uses internal connections for `GND`, `V+` (+3v3), and `RAW` (+5v).

## Where to find the parts

All of the parts are stored in the *fzpz* folder.
